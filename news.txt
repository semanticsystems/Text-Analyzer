Meet this year's Fat Bear Week champion

A new queen has emerged at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska – a defensive single mama bear known for being "one of the fattest" at Brooks River. Explore.org and park officials announced Tuesday that 128 Grazer has been crowned the winner of the 2023 Fat Bear Week to join the "Hall of Chompions."

"The gutsy girl grounded the guy with a gut," Katmai National Park posted on Facebook. "The Mondo mountain of a male, 32 chunk, proved his prominent posterior was worthy of a whopping win (Chin up, Chunk). But in the end, Chunk got Grazered."

Grazer, they said, is the "bear with the biggest beardonkadonk." She received an overwhelming majority of the votes in the final round – 108,321 votes against 23,134.

"Let's crown our Queen that's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal, 128 Grazer," they added. "Long live the Queen!"
